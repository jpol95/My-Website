    <h2>Stories</h2>
    <p>Here, you can view a sample of my writing from three of the stories I've written.
        I'm currently working on a manuscript about the secret rooms in our houses
        we never visit. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p id = "story"><i>Katie! Katie! Katie!” said Janiece, her shrill voice echoing through the playground and driving spears through Mr. London’s eardrums. A grimace later, Mr. London shouted back, “Hey, Hawthorn! Katie’s 3 feet away from you! I can’t wait to scream in your ear when we get back inside!” <br> <br>

        Janiece rolled her eyes and shrugged off the slight. Mr. London had always been mean to her, even if she was taking deliberate steps to avoid provoking him. Eventually, she resigned herself to the fact that she would be his least favorite student and took extra care to vex him, such as shouting for her best friend at full volume right next to him. <br> <br>
        
        Janiece and Katie exchanged an imperceptible smirk before scurrying towards the bushes near the slides. <br><br>
        
        “I told you we’ll get in trouble if we keep doing that!” protested Janiece, her knees still trembling and her breath still short. “I don’t wanna get written up again. Mom’s gonna kill me!!”<br><br>
        
        Katie looked up at her friend with a blank expression before burying her face in the bush in front of her. She thought about her response for a minute before smirking again and saying, “Shut up, you know you wanna do it again.” <br><br>
        
        Janiece gazed at the bush with her friend, letting the thrill of defiance fester in her stomach, deciding if she liked the way it made her feel, or if it were another one of those urges that she should repress, like the desire to hit a boy after he steps on the bird’s nest you toiled all day to construct out of twigs and leaves. <br><br>
        
        Ultimately, she decided she liked the feeling.<br><br>
        
        As they both turned around and headed straight towards Mr. London, Katie firmly clasping a ball of sand that was to go down his shirt, they spotted a thin, pale girl crouching behind the bush at which they had just finished convening. She had toothpick arms and disproportionately large, bulging eyes that almost protruded over her nose. <br><br>
        
        “What’re you doing here, weirdo?”<br><br>
        
        “I...I’m sorry,” whispered ghostgirl. <br><br>
        
        “Stop being a creep Sasha!” shouted Janiece. “You were, um, beesdropping on us!”<br><br>
        
        The neologism clearly puzzled both Katie and Sasha, who both arched their eyebrows and tilted their heads slightly to the right. 
        <br><br>
        Janiece rolled her eyes, wondering why she even bothers. “Beesdropping, dummies. It’s when you listen to other people talk and you not supposed to!”
        <br><br>
        Sasha grew indignant at the mere suggestion. “I was not beesdropping! I was hiding.”
        <br><br>
        “Liar!” shouted Katie. “You weren’t playing hide-and-go-seek cause you don’t have any friends!”
        <br><br>
        “No!” snapped Sasha. “I didn’t say I was playing hide-and-go-seek. I said I was hiding.”
        <br><br>
        “How come you were hiding?” asked Janiece.
        <br><br>
        “Cause Mr. London yelled at me this morning cause I forgot my pencil at home and asked to borrow his and it's the third time I forgot my pencil.”
        <br><br>
        Digesting this new juicy information, Janiece and Sasha exchanged quick glances, exchanging a plan with their eyes before turning back to the weird girl. Katie said, “Ok, Sasha. I tell you what. If you take this sand in my hand and stuff it down Mr. London’s shirt, you can be our friend.”<br><br>
        
        Sasha’s mouth watered at the prospect. She had an awkward posture and glasses before anyone else did, so people tended to classify her as awkward and marked her in their heads under the “avoid” column. Despite desperate efforts on her part, no one wanted to be her friend. At least, until now. But the dilemma, of course, was that if she took the tempting offer, she’d have to do something that went against the very marrow of her being. She was, by nature, non-confrontational, and avoided trouble at all cost, so to actively seek it, by physically assaulting a teacher no less, was a thought that repulsed her to her very core. 
        <br><br>
        For a seven-year-old, she weighed the two options very rationally. Get into trouble today, have Mr. London make an unfortunate phone call home, and get grounded or yelled at by mom for a week, or go through the rest of elementary school with no friends.
        <br><br>
        It was that day that everyone on the playground learned that when Mr. London screamed, he sounded more or less like one of the Kindergarteners. Mr. London learned something that day too: although spiders often live in webs, many burrow themselves in sand as well, ready to be clenched in the tight fist of a vengeful seven-year-old girl.
